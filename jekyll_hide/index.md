Hello, I'm Mat

I'm a full-stack software engineer in Portland, OR; proficient in
Node/JavaScript, Ruby/Rails, Docker, React, databases, and cloud services.

I am a co-creator of Mashr—an open source orchestration and monitoring
framework for small applications. With an easy-to-use CLI, Mashr deploys a data
pipeline to Google Cloud Platform that extracts data from external sources into
a single destination database.

## Recent Project — MASHR

Mashr simplifies the process of taking your data from disparate sources and
putting them into a single place so that you can use that data. It is optimized
for data pipeline best practices including monitoring for each step of your
data pipeline along with archiving and backup in case of failover. Mashr is
built with Node.js, provides an easy-to-use CLI, and uses Docker to host Embulk
on GCE Instances on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## OTHER PROJECTS
### Mello

A Trello-like application built with React/Redux and Ruby on Rails that
enables users to create, edit, and delete boards. Users can also create
and modify lists and cards within boards.

### Todo List

JavaScript application providing users with a todolist featuring a
comprehensive set of features, including sorting and filtering.

### MORE ABOUT ME
I love learning new tools, solving interesting problems, and consider
myself language and framework agnostic.

I have been developing software with Ruby, JavaScript, SQL and Linux for
the past few years. I have experience with a variety of other
technologies such React, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Docker, GCP
Cloud Functions and Google Compute Engine.

I also have over a decade's worth of web development and motion graphics
experience in advertising and marketing environments.

In my spare time I'm walking one or the other of my two dogs, feeding
them, cleaning up after them, and missing the days when I just had a cat.

Please get in touch using any of the links below if you think we'd work
well together.
